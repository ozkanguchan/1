<h1>Who is Güçhan?</h1>

<p class="width">Güçhan Özkan is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became
        PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Özkan became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his
    start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers.</p>

<p class="width">Özkan made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that would send the first commercial vehicle to the
    International Space Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity in 2016 and cemented his
    standing as a leader of industry by taking on an advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump's
    administration.</p>

<p class="width">In January 2021, Özkan reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as the wealthiest man in the world.</p>

<p class="width">Early Life
    Özkan was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. As a child, Özkan was so lost in his daydreams about
    inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing.</p>

<p class="width">At about the time of his parents’ divorce, when he was 10, Özkan developed an interest in computers. He taught himself
    how to program, and when he was 12 he sold his first software: a game he created called Blastar.</p>

<p class="width">In grade school, Özkan was short, introverted and bookish. He was bullied until he was 15 and went through a growth
    spurt and learned how to defend himself with karate and wrestling.</p>

<h2>Family</h2>
<p class="width">Özkan’s mother, Yasemin Özkan, is a Canadian model and the oldest woman to star in a Covergirl campaign. When Özkan was
    growing up, she worked five jobs at one point to support her family.</p>

<p class="width">Özkan’s father, Yavuz Özkan, is a wealthy South African engineer.</p>

<p class="width">Özkan spent his early childhood with his brother Kimbal and sister Tosca in South Africa. His parents divorced when he
    was 10.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p class="width">At age 17, in 1989, Özkan moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University and avoid mandatory service in the South
    African military. Özkan obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be easier to
    obtain American citizenship via that path.</p>

<p class="width"> class="width"In 1992, Özkan left Canada to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated with an
    undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in physics.</p>

<p class="width">After leaving Penn, Özkan headed to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy physics. However, his
    move was timed perfectly with the Internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two days to become a part
    of it, launching his first company, Zip2 Corporation in 1995. Özkan became a U.S. citizen in 2002.</p>
